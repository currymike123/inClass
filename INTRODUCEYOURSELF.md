I have an undergraduate degree in Digital Art from The College of New Jersey (2005).  I spent the next 10 years of my career as a photographic retoucher. Exhibition printer, and Colorist.  Around 2015 I started to get back into coding and took the CS50 course on edx.org.  I was hooked from there and taught myself web programming and image manipulation mainly using [Processing](https://processing.org/) a Java coding framework and it’s JavaScript cousin [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).  

I’ve created a few projects and apps.  The main project I have been working on is called [The Enigma Room](https://www.enigmaroom.me/).  It’s a collaboration with a team of photographers, video editors, and producers.  I contributed all the image effects created with Processing.  

I’ve also built two apps.  The [Arrivals Booth](https://newestamericans.com/arrivals/), an interactive photo booth that recorded each participants arrival story to America.  Since launch we have had over 500 people record their stories.  Also, [Poem Quest](https://poemquest.com/), an interactive GPS controlled game where players search Riverfront Park in Newark for hidden poems.  

I hope to advance my skills in app creation during the semester especially in server/client programming.  Then take these skills to build even more advanced apps for my clients.  I’m excited for the year!
